# Psets for Econ-244

## Installation

If you are reading this, then you have a Github account. However, to work on your computer and interact with the repository, you'll need git on your own computer. You can download git at [this link](https://git-scm.com/downloads).

Once you have installed git, you can access git via the **command line**. Christina, for mac, you will access this through the **terminal**. Sam, for Windows, you will access this via the git command line. There are GUI options, but I find them quite complicated. For the rest of this guide, when I mention **command line** I will mean the terminal for Christina and the git command line tool for Sam. 

To check that you have git correctly installed, open the command line and type

```
git --version
```

## Cloning the repository

The git model is to have a central **repository** stored on github. Each of us will have our own **local** copies of the repository. To get hooked up with the central repository, you will need to **clone** it. Open the command line and navigate to your folder and type

```
git clone https://github.com/PrestonMui/244-psets
```
this will create a folder called ```244-psets``` in the working directory, with the contents of the git repo. You can change the name of this folder however you please. So, for example, I have a folder on my computer at ```Dropbox/berkeley/244```. I navigated to that folder and cloned the repo there, creating ```Dropbox/berkeley/244/244-psets```.
